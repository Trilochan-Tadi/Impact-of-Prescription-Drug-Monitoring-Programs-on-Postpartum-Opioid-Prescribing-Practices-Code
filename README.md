**Impact of Prescription Drug Monitoring Programs on Postpartum Opioid Prescribing Practice**

These scripts will reproduce the analyses reported in the manuscript. The objective of this paper is to assess whether states that implemented PDMPS before 2016 experienced changes in postpartum opioid prescribing patterns compared to states that adopted PDMPs later.

We created our analytical cohort using Python 3.11.5. The codes are found in the folder "Cohort creation ", and our statistical analysis is found in the folder named "Statistical Analysis". Statistical Analysis was conducted using R Studio.
